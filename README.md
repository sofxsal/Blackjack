Part 1: Starting the game

    1. In Blackjack, the player plays against the dealer.
    2. The dealer gives the player two cards faceup.
    3. The dealer also starts with two cards. But, only one of the dealer's cards is faceup. The other is facedown.

Part 2: During the game

    1. First, it's the player's turn. The player can decide to hit or stay.
    2. hit: draw another card.
    3. stay: do nothing.
    4. If the player decides to hit, and their hand value exceeds 21, they go bust (lose).
    5. Once the player decides to stay, the dealer reveals the hidden card.
    6. Then, the dealer must hit until their cards total up to 17. At 17 points or higher, the dealer must stay.
    7. You win if your hand value is higher than the dealer's hand.
    8. You win if the dealer goes bust (exceeds 21)
    9. You lose if the dealer's hand value is higher than yours.
